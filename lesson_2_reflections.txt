What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans: Git creates a new repo for the current directory
I need to do this in order to start using git to versionize my files in the directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans: the staging area holds files before they are commited
while working directory is the current version of your repo that you are working on
Repo is all your files and their commits tracked by git
