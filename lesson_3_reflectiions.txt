When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: Remote repo will be useful when I wish to share my code with the public or want others to contribute to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Manual pull will enable you decide when to obtain commits from remote repo, hence giving you more control.
